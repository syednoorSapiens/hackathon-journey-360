## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-04

### Bug Fixes

#### Clipboard API Error Fixed
- **Issue**: `NotAllowedError: Failed to execute 'writeText' on 'Clipboard'`
- **Root Cause**: Modern browsers block the Clipboard API when permissions policy doesn't allow it
- **Solution**: Implemented robust clipboard utility with automatic fallback
  - Created `/utils/clipboard.ts` with `copyToClipboard()` function
  - Primary: Uses modern `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`
  - Fallback: Uses legacy `document.execCommand('copy')` with hidden textarea
  - Graceful error handling with user feedback via toast notifications

#### Updated Components
- `SchemaViewer.tsx`: Schema copy functionality now uses fallback-safe clipboard
- `DeploymentPanel.tsx`: URL and cURL command copying now uses fallback-safe clipboard

### Design Enhancements

#### Vibrant Icon Containers
Replaced muted gray icon containers with vibrant colors from the design system:

**Color Mapping:**
- **Accent (Cyan Blue #0EA5E9)**: Text/Code related icons
  - Landing page "Paste as Text" mode
  - SchemaViewer empty state
  
- **Purple (#A855F7)**: Speech/Audio related icons
  - Landing page "Speech to Text" mode
  - InputRequirementScreen speech mode header
  - Recording button (non-recording state)
  
- **Success (Green #22C55E)**: Upload/File/Success related icons
  - Landing page "Upload Document" mode
  - InputRequirementScreen upload mode header
  - File upload icon and uploaded file icon
  - Guidelines checkmarks
  - TestViewer empty state
  
- **Warning (Orange #FB923C)**: AI/Deploy/Action related icons
  - Landing page header "Create with AI" sparkle icon
  - DeploymentPanel empty state

#### Updated Components
- `LandingPage.tsx`: All three input mode cards now have vibrant colored icon containers
- `InputRequirementScreen.tsx`: Header icons, upload zone, file display, and guideline checkmarks
- `SchemaViewer.tsx`: Empty state icon container
- `TestViewer.tsx`: Empty state icon container
- `DeploymentPanel.tsx`: Empty state icon container

## Mock Scenarios

### Travel Insurance Journey (Active)
The system is currently configured with a comprehensive travel insurance mock scenario that demonstrates the full capability of the AI 360 platform. **Regardless of what prompt you enter, the system will generate the Travel Insurance Quote & Buy journey.**

**Mock Scenario Details:**
- **Use Case**: Seamless travel insurance purchase through a guided multi-step wizard
- **Steps**: 5-step journey (Trip Info → Traveler Info → Coverage → Payment → Confirmation)
- **Fields**: 40+ form fields with comprehensive validations
- **Layout**: Wizard layout with step indicators
- **API Endpoints**: 9 mock endpoints including plan fetching, premium calculation, and policy issuance
- **Tests**: 25+ generated tests including travel-specific validations

**Journey Steps:**
1. **Trip Information**: Type, destination, dates, number of travelers
2. **Traveler Information**: Personal details, passport, address (repeatable for multiple travelers)
3. **Coverage & Add-ons**: Bronze/Silver/Gold plans with optional add-ons
4. **Review & Payment**: Payment method selection with card details
5. **Confirmation**: Policy number and download link

This mock scenario showcases:
- Complex wizard forms with conditional logic
- Multi-step validation flows
- Dynamic premium calculations
- API integration patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Industry-specific business rules (age limits, trip duration, passport validation)

To restore normal AI parsing, modify `/utils/aiParser.ts` to use the original parsing logic.

This is a **demo/prototype application**. The login system is designed for demonstration purposes only and does not implement actual authentication or password validation.

**For production use, you would need to:**
- Integrate with a real authentication system (e.g., Auth0, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth)
- Implement proper password hashing
- Add session management
- Enforce password complexity rules
- Add email verification
- Implement rate limiting

## 💡 Tips

- The **demo credentials are clearly visible** on the login screen - you don't need to remember them
- Any credentials work - this allows for quick demonstrations and testing
- The onboarding can be **skipped** if you want to go directly to the main screen
- Dark mode toggle is available in the top-right corner of all screens
